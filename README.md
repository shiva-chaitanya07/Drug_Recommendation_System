üìö Machine Learning Algorithms
This project employs several machine learning algorithms to accurately predict drug recommendation outcomes:

(a) Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. It's suitable for classification tasks.
(b) Support Vector Machine (SVM)

SVM is a supervised learning model that analyzes data for classification and regression analysis. It works well for high-dimensional spaces.
(c) Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier

SGD Classifier implements regularized linear models with stochastic gradient descent learning, which is particularly efficient for large datasets.
(d) Naive Bayes

Naive Bayes is a family of simple probabilistic classifiers based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between the features.
(e) Decision Tree

Decision Tree is a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. It splits the data into subsets based on the most significant attributes.
ü§î Problem Formulation
The Drug Recommendation System addresses the challenge of identifying effective drugs based on user reviews. With numerous reviews available online, it becomes crucial to efficiently analyze and classify these reviews to provide meaningful recommendations. This project aims to analyze drug review data and develop predictive models to classify the sentiment of reviews, thereby assisting users in making informed decisions.

Key Challenges:

Identifying effective drugs from user reviews.
Developing predictive models to assess the sentiment of reviews.
